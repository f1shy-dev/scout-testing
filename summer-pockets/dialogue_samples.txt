SUMMER POCKETS REFLECTION BLUE - DIALOGUE SAMPLES
=================================================

[COMMON ROUTE - Beach Scene]
Hairi: "This island really is beautiful. I can see why Grandmother loved it here."
Shiroha: "The summer here is special! It's like time moves differently, you know?"
Ao: "Time... yes, it flows strangely on Torishirojima."
Kamome: "You two are being weird again. It's just a normal summer!"
Tsumugi: "Perhaps... but even normal summers can become extraordinary memories."

[SHIROHA ROUTE - Festival Preparation]
Shiroha: "Hairi! You have to help me with the festival decorations!"
Hairi: "Of course, but are you sure you're not taking on too much?"
Shiroha: "No way! This is going to be the best summer festival ever! I want everyone to have amazing memories."
Hairi: "Your enthusiasm is infectious, Shiroha. But remember to take breaks."
Shiroha: "Hehe, you worry too much! But... thanks for caring."

[AO ROUTE - Memory Fragment Discovery]  
Ao: "Do you ever feel like you've lived this moment before?"
Hairi: "Sometimes... especially here on the island. It's like déjà vu."
Ao: "What if it's not déjà vu? What if we really have been here before?"
Hairi: "That's impossible... isn't it?"
Ao: "On this island, the impossible becomes possible. Memory and reality blur together."

[TSUMUGI ROUTE - Time Loop Revelation]
Tsumugi: "The summer never ends, Hairi. It just repeats, over and over."
Hairi: "What are you saying? That doesn't make sense."
Tsumugi: "I've watched this same summer happen countless times. Watched you all make the same choices, the same mistakes."
Hairi: "But why? Why would this happen?"
Tsumugi: "Because someone wished for it. Someone wanted this summer to last forever."

[REFLECTION BLUE - Shiki Route Introduction]
Shiki: "There are inconsistencies in the stories people tell about this island."
Hairi: "What kind of inconsistencies?"
Shiki: "Dates that don't match up. Events that people remember differently. It's like there are gaps in the island's history."
Hairi: "Maybe people just remember things wrong?"
Shiki: "No. This is systematic. Someone is hiding something, and I intend to find out what."

[REFLECTION BLUE - Miki Route Art Scene]
Miki: "I... I drew this picture of you, Hairi-kun. But it's not very good..."
Hairi: "Are you kidding? This is amazing! You really captured the feeling of summer."
Miki: "R-really? You think so?"
Hairi: "Absolutely. You have real talent, Miki."
Miki: "Maybe... maybe I can show you more of my drawings sometime?"

[REFLECTION BLUE - Umi Route Beach Discovery]
Umi: "Look! I found the prettiest seashell!"
Hairi: "Wow, that's beautiful. The colors are incredible."
Umi: "Onee-chan says each shell holds a memory of the ocean. Do you think that's true?"
Hairi: "I think your sister is very wise. What memory do you think this one holds?"
Umi: "Maybe... maybe it remembers this moment, with you and me by the water."

[EMOTIONAL CLIMAX SAMPLE - Generic Key Style]
"The summer sun began to set, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and purples. As the waves gently lapped against the shore, I realized that this moment - this perfect, fleeting moment - was what I would carry with me forever. Not just the memory of what happened, but the feeling of being truly alive, truly connected to someone else, in a way that transcends time itself."
